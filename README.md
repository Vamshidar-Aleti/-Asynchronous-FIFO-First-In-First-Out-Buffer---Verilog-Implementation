# -Asynchronous-FIFO-First-In-First-Out-Buffer---Verilog-Implementation
This project implements an Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog with parameterized data and address widths. The design allows for data transfer between two clock domains using Gray code pointer synchronization, ensuring reliable communication between different frequency clocks.
